The Breakdown App Administration Portal

# Setup and running
1. `yarn install` - To install all deps
2. `yarn start` - To boot up the server on localhost


IMPORTANT:
You can specify the API BASE_URL within the  `src/services/urls/index.ts` file. 

##### TODO: Move the BASE URL to an `.env` file

## Deployment
- The platform has been deployed to GH Pages, but any static server should suffice.
